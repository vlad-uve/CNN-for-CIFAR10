##This project was created for the course "YCBS 258 - Practical Machine Learning" at Mcgill University

Alexnet architecture was chosen as a reference for the architecture of the model, but significantly simplified

Task scope implies simplifications as well

alexnet is aimed improve accuracy

Alexnet architecture was chosen as a reference for the architecture of the model, but significantly simplified due to the platform limitations and task scope

kernel size is 5x5 because the input is 32x32


 #Choosing not to incorporate a pooling layer after the initial convolution layer
